## NHS_elective_demand_app
NHS elective and demand web app made on R shiny

There are 2 excel version of model, 1 for the pre-covid, and the other for covid.

project.R is the file for the shiny app. And list.csv is required for this app to run.

This is still work in progress, does not represent the final look. But can certainly be useful to showcase my shiny and function building skill.

## AZ file automation project

I have also included the test.R as AstraZeneca file automation project, that this app uses OCR to extract text from pdf and I designed an algorithm to extract key information for renaming and refiling those files. It also generates a metadata in csv for interface with other systems. It reduced the manual processing time from 5 minutes to 2 seconds per document.
